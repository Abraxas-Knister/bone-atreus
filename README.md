This is a WIP bone layout for the keyboardio atreus using qmk.

Bone is a multi layered keyboard layout for german, where character placement has been optimised so that fingers have to travel less.
Because it is used for German, the layout expects that the system has a German keyboard layout set, like with 

  setxkbmap de nodeadkeys

This README doesn't document the layout, see commit messages instead, better yet, read the source.
